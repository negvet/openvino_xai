# Style Guide for Python Code

## 1 Introduction

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising [OpenVINO-XAI (OV-XAI)](../../README.md).

This style guide supplements the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
with a list of *dos and don'ts* for Python code. If no guidelines were found in this style guide then
the [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) should be followed.
